# Basic Blog Project

Hey! This is a simple blog website I made using Python and Flask. You can create posts, read them, leave comments, and even edit or delete posts.

## Features
- **Home Page:** See a list of all blog posts.
- **Create Post:** Make a new blog post with a title and body.
- **View Post:** Click on a post to read it, see comments, and add your own comment.
- **Edit Post:** Change the title or body of a post.
- **Delete Post:** Remove a post if you don't want it anymore.
- **Comments:** Anyone can leave a comment on a post.

## How It Works
- The app is built with Flask (a Python web framework).
- Posts and comments are saved in a SQLite database (`posts.db`).
- HTML templates are in the `templates/` folder. They use Jinja2 for dynamic content.
- CSS is in the `static/` folder to make it look a bit nicer.
- The main code is in `app.py`.


## Why I Made This
I wanted to learn more about web development and how to use Flask. This project helped me understand how to connect a website to a database, handle forms, and use templates.
